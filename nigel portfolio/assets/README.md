## How to Add Your Files

1. **Profile Photo**: 
   - Add your headshot as `profile.jpg` in the `/assets/` folder
   - Recommended: Square image, 400x400px or larger
   - Formats: JPG, PNG

2. **Resume**:
   - Add your resume PDF as `resume.pdf` in the `/assets/` folder
   - The download button will automatically link to this file

3. **Certificates**:
   - Add certificate images to `/assets/certificates/`
   - Name them: cert1.jpg, cert2.jpg, cert3.jpg, etc.
   - Recommended format: JPG or PNG
   - The website will display them in the Certificates section

## Placeholder Images

Until you add your own images, the website will show placeholder images or broken image icons. This is normal and will be fixed once you upload your actual files.

## Tips

- Use high-quality images for best results
- Optimize images for web (compress them to reduce file size)
- Keep certificate images readable and professional
- Update the certificate details in `index.html` to match your actual certificates
